# HSBC EventBus & Throttler Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation ✅

I have successfully completed **both exercises** from the HSBC Back End take-home with **clean, concise, production-ready** implementations:

- **Exercise 1**: EventBus with single-threaded and multi-threaded versions
- **Exercise 2**: Rolling window-based Throttler with poll and push capabilities

### Core Components Delivered

1. **EventBus Interface** - Clean contract with publishEvent, addSubscriber, and addSubscriberForFilteredEvents
2. **SingleThreadedEventBus** - publishEvent thread = callback thread, immediate processing
3. **MultiThreadedEventBus** - publishEvent thread ≠ callback thread, supports multiple producers/consumers
4. **Sample Events** - MarketDataEvent and TradeEvent classes
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - Concise tests with proper assertions (no verbose println)
6. **Performance Benchmarks** - Streamlined performance comparison

### Key Features Implemented

#### EventBus (Exercise 1)
✅ **Single-threaded version** - Same thread for publish and callback
✅ **Multi-threaded version** - Separate threads for publish and callback
✅ **Multiple producers/consumers** - Full concurrency support
✅ **Event filtering** - Subscribe to specific event types
✅ **Inheritance matching** - Parent subscribers receive child events
✅ **Event coalescing** - High-frequency update optimization
✅ **Thread safety** - Concurrent collections, minimal locking
✅ **Error isolation** - Subscriber failures don't affect others

#### Throttler (Exercise 2)
✅ **Rolling window throttling** - Accurate rate limiting over time windows
✅ **Poll-based checking** - `shouldProceed()` for immediate decisions
✅ **Push-based notifications** - Callbacks when throttling allows proceeding
✅ **Thread safety** - Concurrent access from multiple threads
✅ **Configurable limits** - Customizable operation counts and time windows
✅ **Integration ready** - Works seamlessly with EventBus

#### Testing & Quality
✅ **Clean assertions** - Proper test validation without verbose output
✅ **Comprehensive coverage** - All features thoroughly tested
✅ **Integration tests** - EventBus + Throttler working together

### Advanced Features

- **Event Coalescing**: Processes only latest events of each type for rapid market data
- **Inheritance Support**: Subscribers for Object.class receive all events
- **Configurable Thread Pools**: Custom ExecutorService support
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper resource cleanup
- **Monitoring**: Subscriber counts and queue size metrics

### Concise Testing ✅

**Functional Tests** (`EventBusTest.java`) - **130 lines**
- Clean test runner with proper assertions
- Tests all core functionality
- No verbose println output
- Clear pass/fail reporting

**Performance Benchmarks** (`PerformanceBenchmark.java`) - **118 lines**  
- Streamlined performance comparison
- Tests 10K events with multiple subscribers
- Measures throughput and coalescing effectiveness

### Build & Run

**Unix/Mac:** `chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh`  
**Windows:** `build.bat`  
**Manual:** `find src -name "*.java" | xargs javac -d build/classes`

### Production Quality

- **Thread Safety**: CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap, ReadWriteLocks
- **Performance**: Minimal object creation, efficient lookups
- **Reliability**: Error isolation, graceful shutdown
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics for operations
- **Clean Code**: Concise, readable, well-documented
